Create your first roguelike!

You have 7 days to create your roguelike by completing its features. But unstable features generate bugs that cost you timeâ€¦ Will you finish your game in time?

## Context

This is my first participation to a game jam, namely 7DRL 2019. So this is kind of autobiographical.

## Core mechanics

- You have no hit points but 7 days to make your game. Try not to lose too much time!
- You can control the spawn rate of the bugs by choosing how many unstable features you equip at the same time.
- Weapons and features have ego: find the combinations that work best!
- Depending on the feature that generated them, bugs have special skills. Mapgen bugs can phase, RNG bugs rarely fail their attack.
